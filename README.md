i. OVERVIEW
-----------------------------
This code implements the paper:

>Chunfeng Song, Yongzhen Huang, Yan Huang, Ning Jia, Liang Wang, GaitNet: An end-to-end network for gait based human identification, Pattern Recognition, 2019

iii. USE
-----------------------------
This code should work on Caffe with Python layer (pycaffe). You can install Caffe from: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe

(1) Data Preparation.

Download the gait datasets and their masks: CASIA-b([apply link](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/Gait%20Databases.asp)), Outdoor-Gait ([Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1oW6u9olOZtQTYOW_8wgLow) with extract code (tjw0) OR [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XRWq40G3Zk03YaELywxuVKNodul4TziG?usp=sharing)), and SZU RGB-D Gait ([apply link](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/yusq/))

Note: All images should be pre-cropped guided by the corresponding segmentations.

(2) Model Training.

Here, we take CASIA-b as an example. The other two datasets are the same.
>cd ./experiments/casiab

First eidt the 'CAFFE_ROOT' in 'train_net.sh', and 'im_path', 'gt_path' and 'dataset' in the prototxt files. 

Then, we can train the GaitNet model with the commands in 'train_net.sh'. For each step, it will take roughly 24 hours for single Titan X.
>sh train_net.sh

(3) Evaluation.

Run the code in './eval/eval-casiab/outdoor/szu.py'. If you did not train this model, just want run the inference, you could download the pre-trained model from [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/111N5wcsZ09jjA9rpMrM1Qw) with extract code (ne65).
